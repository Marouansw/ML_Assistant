# ðŸ”¹Retrievel Augmented Generation For Machine Learning 

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an approach that enhances AI-generated responses by integrating information retrieval from a knowledge base with a large language model (LLM). This project implements a RAG system designed to assist users in identifying the necessary data for their machine learning use cases.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a RAG-based system that helps users determine the essential features and data requirements for their Machine Learning tasks by:
- Extracting relevant data from datasets
- Storing structured information for efficient retrieval
- Generating insightful responses based on user queries
