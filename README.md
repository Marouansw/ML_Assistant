# 🔹ML_Assistant -- An AI-powered Assistant for Optimizing ML Workflows (Automation & Guidance)


## 🎯 Project Goal
In this project, we :
 > Developed an intelligent conversational assistant to streamline and optimize machine learning work-
flows  
 > Laverage advanced LLMs capabilities to automate various machine learning tasks (Model (prediction , segmentation ...) Creation, Data Processing, Data Visualization ...) from natural language requests         
 > Integrate an advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation [RAG] pipeline to guide users through their machine learning use cases
